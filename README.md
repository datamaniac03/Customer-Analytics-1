# Customer-Analytics
A series of 4 RMarkdown reports aimed at demonstrating the value of data and analytics to an emerging markets conglomerate with diverse business interests.

This repository contains:
 
1. RMarkdown report that Identify managerially relevant subgroups in a customer database.

2. Build a model that predicts customer churn.

3. Build a model that predicts the spending level of customers predicted to remain loyal.

4. Estimate the lifetime value of each customer.

Analyses are performed in a very narrow feature space. Although this will likely restrict the performance of predictive models, the dataset is representative of the limited data currently available within most of our subsidiaries.
